### Re:Zero Movie {#ReZERO-id}

The story follows Subaru Natsuki, a 17-year-old high school student who is transported to a fantasy world while on his way home from a convenience store. He meets a silver-haired half-elf girl named Emilia, and together they embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of this new world.

However, their adventures are repeatedly disrupted by Subaru’s ability to “return by death,” where he dies and relives the same day or scenario. This phenomenon allows him to try different approaches and alter the course of events, but it also comes with the risk of being trapped in an infinite loop.

Throughout the story, Subaru forms connections with various characters, including Emilia, Rem, and others, and becomes entangled in their struggles and conflicts. As he navigates this new world, Subaru must confront his own mortality and the consequences of his actions, all while trying to find a way to escape the time loop and return to his own world.
